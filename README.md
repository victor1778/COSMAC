# COSMAC
The COSMAC Chip-8 Emulator is a C++ project that aims to bring back the nostalgic charm of early computing by emulating the CHIP-8 system. The project takes its name from the COSMAC VIP, a pioneering microcomputer from the 1970s that introduced many enthusiasts to the world of computing. This emulator serves as a tribute to those early days while utilizing modern programming techniques.

# What is CHIP-8?
The CHIP-8 is a simple and compact virtual machine designed in the mid-1970s. Originally intended for computer systems like the COSMAC VIP, it was used to develop games and educational software. The system's limited instruction set and memory may seem primitive by today's standards, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into the roots of computing.
